<p><font size="11" color="#0030F7">Since we were able to win the war with our allies our people and even others can now be safe from those who treated their people horribly. We can honor those who fought and died in that war so their deeds can be remembered. We shouldn’t only honor our people but also those who fought in what they believed what was right, because no matter what we are all human and we all have families and friends that we love. If it weren’t for these soldiers sacrifices will would surely still be scorned by the those who use their power for evil in the east.</font>
