<p><font size="11" color="#FFF5F5">For centuries soldiers have taken part in wars for their countries so that their people can be safe and free. Some of those names get forgotten on the battlefields and their deeds go unnoticed. Sometimes what these soldiers fight for isn't always completely right, but they still gave their life for their family and friends and country. Our job as a people should be to remember these people and what they've done for use so their deeds don't go unnoticed. This paper is to show what our Canadian soldiers have done to contribute to the Vietnam War.</font>
