<p><font size="11" color="#53FF00">Canadians partook in the Vietnam War by sending peacekeepers to protect and enforce the Paris Peace Accords. There were about 20,000 to 40,000 Canadian soldiers who enlisted into this war and only 134 deaths were recorded. These Canadians risked their lives so that communism would destroy its own people. Because of Canadas aid the war officially ended in April 1975 where many refugees of about 69,000 were accepted into Canada giving them freedom.</font>
